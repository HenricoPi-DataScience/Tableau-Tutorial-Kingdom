"Alvey Kulina owns and operates a mixed martial arts gym called Navy St. Gym in Venice, 
California, with his girlfriend, Lisa. He helps people work out and trains fighters 
along with his sons, Nate and Jay. Jay has a drug and alcohol problem, but puts it 
aside to start fighting again and Nate is dealing with personal issues as well. 
Ryan Wheeler used to be a great fighter who left Alvey when he got big until he was
 sent to prison after brutally assaulting his father. After Ryan's release, Alvey 
wants him to fight again and be his trainer as it would be good publicity for the gym. 
Lisa is initially opposed to this, as she and Ryan used to be engaged, but eventually 
accepts it for the sake of the gym. Alvey's estranged ex-wife, Christina, is a drug 
addict and sex worker, with sporadic contact with Kulina and her sons. 
Fighting is a way of life in this family both in and out of the ring."
